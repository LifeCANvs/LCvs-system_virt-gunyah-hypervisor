interface idle

// Called repeatedly by the idle thread, interleaved with scheduler yields.
// May also be called from non-idle threads if there is nothing else runnable
// on a CPU.
//
// If a handler does not return IDLE_STATE_IDLE, the event will immediately
// return, and the scheduler must be called if IDLE_STATE_RESCHEDULE was
// returned. If all handlers return IDLE_STATE_IDLE, the architecture's basic
// wait-for-event instruction will be executed.
//
// This event is triggered with preemption disabled. A handler may re-enable
// preemption if necessary, but must arrange for any preemptions to
// immediately return true.
