// Routines for handling inter-processor interrupts.
//
// Modules may register an IPI reason code, and an associated handler for the
// ipi_received event. When an IPI is targeted at an online CPU, and has not
// been masked by that CPU, the handler for the IPI's reason code will be run on
// the CPU. Handlers run with preemption disabled, and may run from the idle
// thread or an interrupt handler; they return a boolean value which indicates
// whether a reschedule is needed.
//
// Each handler call is preceded by an acquire barrier which synchronises with
// the release barrier that was performed when the IPI was sent. Any subsequent
// IPI send operation that does not synchronise with that acquire barrier is
// guaranteed to trigger another call to the handler. A duplicate IPI send that
// does synchronise with the handler's acquire barrier may or may not trigger
// another handler call.
//
// If a _relaxed function is used to send an IPI, the targeted CPU(s) will
// handle the IPI next time they switch contexts. There is no particular promise
// of timely handling, even on idle CPUs.
//
// If an _idle function is used to send an IPI, it is guaranteed to be handled
// quickly whenever the targeted CPU(s) are idle. It will avoid interrupting a
// busy CPU if possible. This may be an alias of the corresponding _relaxed
// function if relaxed IPIs are guaranteed to wake idle CPUs; otherwise it is an
// alias of the corresponding normal IPI function. The _idle functions in the
// IPI module interface cannot wake the target CPU from suspend, therefore,
// using these functions incorrectly may lead to an indefinite CPU suspend,
// causing the system to hang.
//
// All of the receive-side functions below must be called with preemption
// disabled, except where noted.

// Send the specified IPI to all online CPUs other than the caller.

// handler, including a handler for a different IPI than the one being cleared.
//
// This function executes an acquire operation before returning true, equivalent
// to the acquire operation that is executed before calling a handler.
//
// If possible, this function will cancel any pending physical IPIs that other
// CPUs have asserted to signal the IPI, but note that not all interrupt
// controllers can reliably cancel an IPI without handling it.
