// Triggered when the scheduler runs and elects not to switch threads.

// This event is triggered when the affinity of a thread is explicitly
// changed. The scheduler lock for the thread is held by the caller.
// If this is too restrictive for a module, handlers can request the
// next event to be triggered after a grace period.
