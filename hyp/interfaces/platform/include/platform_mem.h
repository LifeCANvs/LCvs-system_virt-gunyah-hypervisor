// that has the platform_pgtable flag set. It should return true if there is any
// possibility that an in-progress update of the VM page table has unmapped
// pages temporarily as part of an architecturally required break-before-make
// sequence while changing the block size of an existing mapping.

// If this function returns true, any translation abort in a read-only address

// returns false. The platform code must therefore only return true from this
// function for a bounded period of time.

// Note that it is not necessary for the platform code to handle the race
// between completion of the break-before-make and reporting of a fault that
// occurred before it completed. That race will be handled by the caller.
