// Platform routines for handling hardware IRQs.
//
// These routines presume that the interrupt controller implements automatic
// masking of all interrupts until the end of the handler, and selectively
// extending that masking after the end of the interrupt handler for interrupts
// forwarded to a VM, similar to an ARM GICv2 or later with EOImode=1. If the
// interrupt controller does not implement these semantics, the platform driver
// must emulate them.
//
// The calling code should not assign any particular meaning to IRQ numbers,
// beyond assuming that they are not greater than the value returned by
// platform_irq_max().
//
// Note that the platform driver may handle some IRQs internally; for example,
// to signal IPIs, or to support a debug console. Such IRQs are not exposed to
// this interface.

// Obtain the maximum valid IRQ number.
//
// This returns an irq_t value which is the upper bound for valid irq_t values
// on this platform. Note that it is not necessarily the case that all irq_t
// values less than this value are valid; see platform_irq_check() below.
//
// This function may be called by a default-priority boot_cold_init handler. If
// the driver needs initialisation to determine this value, it should subscribe
// to boot_cold_init with a positive priority.
irq_t
platform_irq_max(void);

// Check whether a specific IRQ number is valid for handler registration.
//
// This function returns ERROR_DENIED for any IRQ number that is reserved by the
// platform driver or by a higher privileged level, ERROR_ARGUMENT_INVALID for
// any IRQ number that is greater than the value returned by platform_irq_max()
// or is otherwise known not to be implemented by the hardware, and OK for any
// other IRQ number.

platform_irq_check(irq_t irq);

// Check whether a specific IRQ number needs to use the percpu and/or local
// variants of the enable and disable APIs.
//
// Note that a true result does not necessarily mean that the IRQ number can be
// used independently on multiple CPUs.
//
// This function must only be called on IRQ numbers that have previously
// returned an OK result from platform_irq_check().

// selects one to acknowledge arbitrarily. Delivery of the acknowledged IRQ is
// disabled until the next platform_irq_deactivate() call for that IRQ, unless a
// platform-specific mechanism deactivates the IRQ.
//
// If there is an interrupt to acknowledge, but it is directed to the platform
// driver itself (e.g. to signal an IPI), the result will be set to ERROR_RETRY.

// it must be called on the same physical CPU that acknowledged the IRQ;
